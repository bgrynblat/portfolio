Customer: **Me**<br>
Role: **Creator**<br>
When: May 2018<br>
Why: I was fed up with getting parking tickets when parking my motorbike in different locations around Sydney, so I decided to build this app which allows you to navigate to the free motorbike parkings around australia and add new ones if missing.<br>

- Design and build Motopark Australia mobile app with ***React Native***.<br>
- Deploy app on both ***Apple App Store*** and ***Google Play Store***.<br>
- Build backend with ***NodeJS*** and deploy on ***Heroku***.<br>
