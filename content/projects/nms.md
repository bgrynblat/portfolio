Customer: **Nurun Global**<br>
Agency: **Nurun Australia**<br>
Role: **Project Manager / DevOps / Full Stack Developer**<br>
When: January 2016 - November 2017<br>
Why: I built this application after suggesting my managers that there is a strong need for an easy-to-use PaaS used to deploy web applications within the Publicis/Nurun agency group at a global scale.<br>
<br>Tasks:<br>
- Design the full application architecture as a ***PaaS***.<br>
- Build both frontend (***AngularJS***) and backend (***NodeJS***).<br>
- Implement the ***AWS*** stack with ***Ruby*** and ***Bash*** scripts.<br>
